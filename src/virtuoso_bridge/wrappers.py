"""Optional decorators around VirtuosoClient.

These are pluggable utilities — the bridge itself stays policy-free.
Users supply their own callables (sanitize_fn, etc.) so the bridge has
no opinion on what is sensitive in a given project.

class SanitizingClient:
    """Wrap a :class:`VirtuosoClient`; every ``download_file()`` also writes
    a sanitized sibling copy to ``<local.parent>/sanitized/<local.name>``.

    The caller supplies the ``sanitize_fn`` callable — the bridge has no
    opinion on *what* is sensitive.  All non-``download_file`` methods are
    transparently delegated to the wrapped client.

        from virtuoso_bridge import VirtuosoClient, SanitizingClient
