"""Create a schematic with direct wires using wire creation APIs.

Demonstrates two ways to draw wires plus three label-cosmetic patterns
that make the resulting schematic readable:

  Wire APIs:
    - schematic_create_wire() — arbitrary polyline through explicit points
    - schematic_create_wire_between_instance_terms() — auto-wire two terminals

  Label patterns (`_clean_label` helper below + offset/branch demo):
    1. Cleaner ``label_term`` defaults — ``extension_length=0.5`` and
       ``justification="lowerCenter"`` keep the text adjacent to the
       wire instead of overlapping the stub.  Bare defaults
       (``extension_length=0.25``, ``"centerCenter"``) leave the text
       sitting on top of the wire stub which renders unreadably on
       small symbols.
    2. Auto-rotation — pick label rotation from the instance rotation:
       R0/R180 instance → horizontal stub → label rotation ``R0``;
       R90/R270 instance → vertical stub → label rotation ``R90``.
       The example RC uses only R0 instances, but the helper handles
       both so it copy-pastes safely.
    3. Off-wire branch label — when the main stub is too crowded to
       carry the label cleanly, draw a perpendicular branch wire
       (electrically equivalent) and place the label at the branch
       tip.  Demonstrated here for the OUT scope point.

NOTE: Wire shapes alone have no electrical meaning — terminals must be
connected to the same named net to carry current.  This example pairs
wire drawing with net labels so the circuit is both visually wired and
electrically connected.

Circuit: RC filter — VDC → R0 → C0 → GND, with IN/OUT pins.

Usage::

    python 10_create_wire.py <LIB>
    python 10_create_wire.py <LIB> <CELL>

Prerequisites:
  - virtuoso-bridge service running (virtuoso-bridge start)
  - analogLib cell masters (vdc, res, cap) available

    stubs) instead of dead-centred over the wire.

    ``instance_rotation`` is the orientation of the *instance* whose
